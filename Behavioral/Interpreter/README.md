# Interpreter design pattern

Interpreter pattern is used to defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an 
interpreter to deal with this grammar.

The best example of interpreter design pattern is java compiler that interprets the java source code 
into byte code that is understandable by JVM. Google Translator is also an example of interpreter pattern where the input can be in any language and we can get the output interpreted in another language.
