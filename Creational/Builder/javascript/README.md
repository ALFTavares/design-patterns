# A Note On JavaScript

The Builder pattern is most commonly referred to as the Constructor pattern. Since most everything in JavaScript, this pattern most often involved _object_ constructors. These constructors are used to control objection creation with arguments values for properties and methods as well as preparing the object for use.

There are two examples given; one for es5 and earlier verions that relies on a generic constructor function and an es6 example that uses the `class` syntax and built-in constructor method.
