The Prototype pattern utilizes [JavaScript's prototypical inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain) to create objects. The prototype object acts as a blueprint for each object that it creates. These newly created objects are shallow clones of the original object. This pattern is very useful when creating objects in resource-intensive situations.
