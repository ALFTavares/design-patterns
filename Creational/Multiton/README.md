# Multiton Pattern

> This pattern guarantees that there is only one instance per key within an application.

The Multiton pattern is similar to the singleton pattern. It ensures that only one instance of an object is associated with a single key. <br>
This pattern simplifies the usage of globally shared objects in an application. Java's [ScriptEngineManager](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/script/ScriptEngineManager.html) is an example implementation of the Multiton pattern.
