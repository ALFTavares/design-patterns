# Design patterns

In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.
Design patterns may be viewed as a structured approach to computer programming intermediate between the levels of a programming paradigm and a concrete algorithm.

## List of implementations

* [Creational](Creational)
  * [Abstrac Factory](Creational/Abstrac%20Factory)
  * [Singleton](Creational/Singleton)
* [Structural](Structural)
* [Behavioral](Behavioral)
* [Concurrency](Concurrency)
  * [Active Object](Concurrency/Active%20Object)

## Contribution
 * Contributions are always welcome. Language doesn't matter. Just make sure you're implementing design pattern.
 * PRs are welcome. To begin developing, follow the structure:

   > category/design pattern name/language-name/file_name.extension
   
   e.g
   
   > Creational/Abstract factory/python/abstract_factory.py
 * Don't forget to add README with explanation how pattern works, when to use and common usage of the pattern.
 * Adding image with UML diagram for design pattern would be very helpfull.
