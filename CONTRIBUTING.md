## Contribution
 * Contributions are always welcome. Language doesn't matter. Just make sure you're implementing design pattern.
 * PRs are welcome. To begin developing, follow the structure:

   > category/design pattern name/language-name/file_name.extension
   
   e.g
   
   > Creational/Abstract factory/python/abstract_factory.py
 * Don't forget to add README with explanation how pattern works, when to use and common usage of the pattern.
 * Adding image with UML diagram for design pattern would be very helpfull.
