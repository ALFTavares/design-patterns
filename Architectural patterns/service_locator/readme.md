# Service locator
The service locator pattern is a design pattern used in software development to encapsulate the processes involved in obtaining a service with a strong abstraction layer. This pattern uses a central registry known as the "service locator", which on request returns the information necessary to perform a certain task.[1] The main criticism of service location is that it obscures dependencies.[2] Meanwhile, its proponents say the approach should not be discarded as it simplifies component-based applications where all dependencies are cleanly listed at the beginning of the whole application design, consequently making traditional dependency injection a more complex way of connecting objects. The usual criticism of service locator pattern as being the one which is "much harder to test" actually becomes a benefit in such applications.
